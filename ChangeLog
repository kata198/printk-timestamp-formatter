* 3.0.0 - Aug 31 2017

* output warnings prefixed with ## WARNING: first on stderr then on
stdout at end (the latter can be disabled via --no-warnings flag)

* Better implementation of reading to ensure if stream pauses, NFS
delays, etc will always provide a complete read (very very very
unlikely small chance before that a partial read could happen)

* BACKWARDS-INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE:

Previously, if there was not a "recent enough" drift (defined by a
static threshold of 12000 seconds, or 3 hours and 20 minutes) we
would abort with error, unless we were root and not reading from a
file, in which case we would mark the end (even though the beginning
could still be inaccurate with long uptimes).

Now, we perform the following:

   ** If no recent drift, scan for ANY drift. If present, use the
   availbale drifts and warn the user (new warning)

   ** If there are no drifts available at all, assume a drift of 0
   and warn the user. This would be equivilant to the output from
   "dmesg -T" and thus not very useful, but means that
   "dmesg_format_dates" can be used unconditionally on all files
   whether or not they contain a drift.

Thus, we work without any drifts or without recent drifts now, and
just warn about the lack of accuracy doing so.

* Some minor cleanups

* Add "--no-mark" flag (and associated updates to library) which will prevent
any attempts to add a mark to the log when collecting drift times if a
recent-enough (12000 seconds) mark is not present.

* Add a "dmesg_get_drifts" command, which will print the time of each marked
drift, and how much the clock has drifted at that point.

  This can be used to evaluate how much your system is drifting to accurately
  tune how often you should be marking. It could also be parsed by an external
  application that can't use the provided python library (like written in a
  different language)

* Fix typo preventing -h from printing help in dmesg_format_dates

* Fix MANIFEST.in missing printk_mark_drift and also typo in
printk_time_convert

* Prefer setuptools for distribution in setup.py (with fallback to distutils)
