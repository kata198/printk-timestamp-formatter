# This provides a library for dealing with printk drift between actual uptime.
#   This will provide a reasonable estimate for recent timestamps, but not a completely accurate picture for all timestamps (can drift by up to an hour in a month's time).
#   For accurate timing, this would need to constantly collect samples.
#   Alternativly, it can use every sample that IS present, and create a set of ranges.
